# WebAssistant

Easily deploy an AI assistant chatbot for your personal website.

This repository contains a Python library and the template for a React app, both of which use state-of-the-art Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting methodologies.

## Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have an OpenAI API key
2. Have the base URL of the website for which you want to create the chatbot

## Using (Just) Python

To use the python library, first install with

```bash
pip install WebAssistant
```

Then, write

```python
from WebAssistant import *
myChatbot = Hub()
myChatbot.launch(YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY, YOUR_WEBSITE)
```

This will create a link to a chatbot built with Gradio that can answer questions about your website.

If you're looking for a very basic (and not recommended) solution, simply iframe the link on your webpage. Note that the link will expire every 3 days and will need to be regenerated using ``launch()``

## Using the React App
For a more flexible solution, run the following Python code. Make sure you have node installed first.

```python
from WebAssistant import *
myChatbot = Hub()
myChatbot.deployReactExpressApp(YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY, YOUR_WEBSITE, YOUR_ROOT_DIRECTORY)
```

This will deploy a React frontend + Express backend to ``localhost:8080``. From there, you can upload it to Cloudflare, Render.com, Fly.io, Railway, or other providers, and then iframe the link generated by those sites inside a dedicated container in your website for the chatbot.

Note that you must NOT remove the credits to this repository included at the bottom of the chatbot UI.
